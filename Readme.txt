Project0 - Implementation of Kahoot quiz!
-> Programming Language I used - "c++"
-> Communication Method - "Inter Process Communication using Shared Memory"
Assumptions:
1. The moderator ask's its children 3 simple mathematics questions.
2. Three questions are asked to each children at once.
3. Each children respond to all three questions at once.
4. Random number generator is used in all the child process to generate random number for all the three questions.
these are the assumptions that are made for this project0

Limitations:
1. User gives input to determine the number of child process that can be created.
2. The random number generated by the child process ranges from 0 to 6.
3. The question asked by the moderator is static.

Known Bugs:
There are no known bugs!

Results:
	The project works as expected.
-> 3 questions are asked by the moderator.
-> Each child generates a random number for each question successfully.
-> Once all the child process generates the answer the moderator give away points for each children.
-> Then kill signal is first sent to child process who gets the maximum points.
-> At last all the child process gets terminated.
